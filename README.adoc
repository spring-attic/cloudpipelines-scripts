= Cloud Pipelines Scripts

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.

You can check out the `docs` folder for the documentation. The deployed docs are available https://cloud.spring.io/cloudpipelines-scripts/[here]
